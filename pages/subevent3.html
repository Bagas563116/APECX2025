        <h1>COMPANY VISIT</h1>
        <hr class="line"></hr>
        <img src="../image/CV1.png" />
        <p>
          As part of the prestigious annual event APECX 2025, the Society of
          Petroleum Engineers Universitas Gadjah Mada Student Chapter (SPE UGM
          SC) proudly organizes the Company Visit program. This initiative
          serves as a valuable opportunity for students, particularly those
          pursuing studies in petroleum engineering, geosciences, and other
          energy-related fields, to gain firsthand exposure to the professional
          environment of the oil and gas industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Company Visit aims to bridge the gap between academic learning and
          industry practices by allowing students to directly observe how
          leading companies operate, understand the latest technological
          advancements, and engage in meaningful discussions with professionals
          in the field.
        </p>
        <img src="../image/CV2.png" />
        <p>
          Each year, the Company Visit is carefully designed to provide
          participants with an in-depth understanding of various aspects of the
          industry, including upstream, midstream, and downstream operations.
          Students will have the opportunity to explore cutting-edge
          technologies, safety protocols, and business strategies implemented by
          industry leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          By engaging in direct interactions with professionals, participants
          will gain valuable insights into career opportunities, industry
          challenges, and the skills required to thrive in this dynamic sector.
          This experience not only enhances their academic knowledge but also
          fosters critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and a deeper
          appreciation of industry standards and best practices.
        </p>
        <img src="../image/CV3.png" />
        <p>
          Furthermore, this initiative strongly aligns with the United Nations‚Äô
          Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 4: Quality
          Education, by promoting experiential learning and facilitating
          knowledge transfer between industry experts and future professionals.
          Through exposure to real-world industry practices, students are better
          equipped to apply theoretical concepts in practical settings, making
          them more prepared for their future careers. Additionally, the program
          encourages discussions on sustainability, energy transition, and the
          role of oil and gas in a rapidly evolving global energy landscape,
          fostering a more holistic understanding of the industry‚Äôs future
          direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          By participating in the Company Visit, students not only expand their
          professional network but also gain a clearer perspective on how their
          academic background can contribute to the industry. This program is a
          vital stepping stone for aspiring professionals, allowing them to
          build connections, gain inspiration, and develop a stronger foundation
          for their careers in the energy sector. As SPE UGM SC remains
          committed to fostering student development and industry collaboration,
          the Company Visit continues to be a key component of APECX, ensuring
          that participants receive a well-rounded and impactful learning
          experience.
